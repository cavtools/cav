# Cav

A collection of primitives for building full-stack web apps with
[Deno](https://deno.land).

**Status:** Ready to play with, but not ready for production.

## Guiding principles

- [Least
  Astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)
- Modular, schema-like server definitions
- No-fuss data serialization
- End-to-end typesafety
- Developer independence
- Use the platform
- Have fun [ðŸŒˆ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_y15ozNchY)

## Goals

- It should do the basics
  - [x] Routing
  - [x] Static asset serving
  - [x] Signed cookies
  - [x] Web sockets
  - [x] Form and JSON parsing
  - [x] De/serialization of most JS data types, including Dates, Maps, Files...
  - [x] Runtime bundling for browser-side TypeScript
  - [x] Works with frontend frameworks like [Preact](https://preactjs.com)
- It shouldn't require any special tooling
  - [x] No config files
  - [x] No CLI commands
- The client-side API should use types imported from the server to fully type
  requests and responses
  - [x] [End-to-end typesafety](https://colinhacks.com/essays/painless-typesafety)
  - [x] Compatible with [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- Its syntax should be functional and declarative
  - [x] Immutable, schema-like Router and Endpoint definitions
  - [x] No middleware patterns
  - [x] Functions all the way down
- It should be as independent as possible
  - [x] Zero third-party dependencies (just Deno)
- Production deployments should be a simple git-commit-push
  - [x] [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com) without a build step
