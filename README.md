I wanted to learn more about backend web frameworks, so I spent a few months
making one.

It's called Cav. It runs on [Deno](https://deno.land).

Tidbits:

- The Basics: Routers, endpoints, cookies, web sockets, etc.
- Built-in end-to-end type safety
- Automatic serialization of most data types
- Browser-side TypeScript bundling (powered by Deno)
- Functional, declarative syntax
- Zero third party dependencies

**NOTE:** Definitely **NOT** production ready, but it does power my [personal
