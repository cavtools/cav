# Cav

NOTE: This is an MVP. Nothing has been properly battle tested. You probably
shouldn't use this in production yet.

Cav is an experimental web framework for [Deno](https://deno.land).

## Goals

- Learn everything I can about backend web frameworks, by creating one
  - [x] Zero third-party dependencies
- It should have everything I need to build a modern web app without
  third-party services
  - [x] Built-in request routing
  - [x] Easy static asset serving
  - [x] (Signed) cookies and JWTs
  - [x] Web socket support
  - [x] Dev-time bundling for TypeScript assets
  - [x] Support frontend frameworks like [Preact](https://preactjs.com)
  - [x] Automatic de/serialization of most data types, including Maps, Sets, etc.
- "Hello world" should be as easy as `deno run`ning a tiny `main.ts`
  - [x] Zero config
  - [x] Zero CLI commands
- The client should use the server types to catch input and output type errors
  at the IDE level
  - [x] [End-to-end type safety](https://colinhacks.com/essays/painless-typesafety)
  - [x] Compatible with [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) data parsers
  - [x] Maximal TypeScript benefits, minimal TypeScript (via type inference)
- It should be functional and declarative
  - [x] Schema-like router and endpoint definitions
  - [x] No hidden context
  - [x] No middleware
  - [x] ~~No magic~~ Yes magic üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Production deployments should be easy
  - [x] [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com) without a build step
