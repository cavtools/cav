I wanted to learn more about backend web frameworks, so I spent a few months
making one.

It's called Cav. It runs on [Deno](https://deno.land).

Features:

- The Basics: Routers, endpoints, (signed) cookies, web sockets, etc.
- Opt-in end-to-end type safety
- De/serialization of most data types (experimental)
- Browser-side TypeScript bundling, powered by Deno
- Functional, declarative syntax
- Zero third party dependencies
- Weird
