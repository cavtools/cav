Ideas: 

- Here me out: What if I *didn't* use the word "framework"?
  - Or the words "application" or "app"... lmao hard mode
  - This might not be possible
- Do use the word "composable"
- "infrastructure"
- Composable routing
- Full-stack applications that don't enforce a particular project structure
