<!--

Let's try this again...

- Don't name-drop other frameworks as a hook
- It's okay to mention sources of inspiration, but you need to explain them
- Good code speaks for itself. (Especially in bite sized pieces)
- Highlight your favorite features (the ones you worked so hard on)
- You're not trying to get them to use it. You're trying to show what you made
- This is not a business.

- This is from you to the reader. Speak with your own voice
