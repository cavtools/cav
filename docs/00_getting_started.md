# Getting started with Cav

These docs assume you're a TypeScript developer with some experience using Deno
and Preact.

I suggest leaving your right-click menu at home. Typing everything manually aids
the learning process, and it's how Cav is intended to be used. You can expand
the "‚ö°Ô∏è Breakdown" drop-downs to get a closer look at what's happening.

To start, we're going to do To-Dos. (It's tradition.)

## 0. Install Deno

Cav needs [Deno](https://deno.land). Install v1.20 or higher.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your IDE, install the [vscode_deno extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno).

## 1. Greet the world

Create a new folder for the project. (This folder will be referred to as
`<root>/` moving forward.)

If you're using Visual Studio Code, create a `.vscode/` folder in `<root>/` and
put a `settings.json` file in there with the following JSON. (Why? [Click
here.](https://deno.land/manual@v1.20.1/vscode_deno#deno-enabling-a-workspace))

```json
{
  // <root>/.vscode/settings.json (don't include this line)
  "deno.enable": true,
  "deno.lint": true
}
```

Create a `main.ts` file in the project `<root>/`, which will be the entrypoint
for the server. Pop this code in there:

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env deno run --watch --allow-net --allow-read

// <root>/main.ts
import {
  assets,
  serve,
  stack,
} from "https://deno.land/x/cav/mod.ts";

const mainStack = stack({
  "*": assets({
    cwd: import.meta.url,
  }),
});

serve(mainStack);
console.log("Listening on port 8000");
```

Now go to your terminal and make that file executable. This lets you easily
start the server with the command `./main.ts`.

```sh
> chmod +x main.ts
```

Next, create an `assets/` folder in `<root>/`, and put an `index.html` file in
it. This will be the landing page. Keep it minimal for now:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"><head>

  <!-- <root>/assets/index.html -->
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>ü•ö To-Dos</title>

</head><body>

  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

</body></html>
```

Drink some water and let your baby gestate for a few minutes. When you're good
and ready, start the server from the terminal and point your browser to
http://localhost:8000.

```sh
> ./main.ts
# ... Deno stuff ...
Listening on port 8000
```

![Screenshot of http://localhost:8000 in a browser window. The text "Hello, world!" is in the top left corner. It's in that stupid serif font you get when you fail to properly link the font CSS. (Is it rude to say stuff like that in an alt text?)](./assets/00_getting_started_hello.png)

Pat yourself on the back for surviving a gestating-baby joke. You did it! ü•≥

## 2. Design the interface

(If you're like me, this is the hardest step to get through. Have yourself a
good cry and psych up for the brutal cost-to-benefit ratio that's barrelling
your way. Don't let it catch you off guard... *it can smell fear.*)

Create a wireframe for the interface using your favorite design software. I'm no
designer, but [Figma](https://figma.com) doesn't care. Below is a video of me
using it to make a really basic prototype. (I sped it up to 1.5x because I'm a
Figma noob. Gotta start somewhere, eh?)

## 3. Build the interface

## 4. API the business logic

## 5. Pipe the data

## 6. Attach a database

## 7. Authenticate users

## 8. Push to production
