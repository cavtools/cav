# 🏆 Hall of Fame 🏆

When someone finds an exploitable bug, they can brag it up in this here **🏆
Hall of Fame 🏆** document. (Or they can choose to remain anonymous, if
desired.) Their accomplishments will be carefully detailed for the sake of open
learning.

If you find a way to break Cav into a billion beautiful pieces, [claim your
spot!](mailto:cav-hall-of-fame@connor.lol) I'd pay you for the help, but I
can't. Hopefully someday. 🙂
